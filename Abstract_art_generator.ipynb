This can be useful for artists \nand designers who want to explore different artistic styles, create unique artworks, or \ngenerate variations of existing art pieces.\n\nKey functionalities of the program:\n1. Load and preprocess images.\n2. Apply the style of one image to the content of another using a style transfer model.\n3. Evaluate the generated image by calculating content loss.\n4.
